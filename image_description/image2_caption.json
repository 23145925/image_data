Clothing is soft and unremarkable in color, serving mainly as a neutral base behind the bird.",
        "pose_and_action": "The man is turned in three-quarter profile, facing left, with his mouth slightly open as though speaking or calling.

Posture suggests close proximity or contact with the bird, possibly holding or standing shoulder-to-shoulder with it.",

His hat overlaps the top of the bird’s head in the frame, and his head and torso form a secondary silhouette behind the bird’s foreground mass.
